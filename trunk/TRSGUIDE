GUIDE FOR CREATING YOU OWN TOURNAMENT RANKING SYSTEMS:
------------------------------------------------------

First of all you will have to be able to read a little PHP, and write some too. Please do not be scared off by this - it's not that difficult and you can't break anything. 
Worst case is that you have to replace the .php files you have edited.

Now, there are 2 files you will have to open. These are:

    - lib/class_tournament.php
    - lib/class_stats.php

------------------------
lib/class_tournament.php
------------------------

In lib/class_tournament.php look for the function definition of "getRSSortRules()" (you can do a search on the string).

Here you must add 2 entries for your new ranking system:

    $rules[4] 
and 
    $pts[4]

You must, of course, use the same syntax as the other definitions use.
    
The team properties used in the $rules[] definitions can be found at the top of lib/class_team.php.
IMPORTANT: Not all team properties are available for sorting against. You will get errors in your browser if you use such team properties. No harm in experimenting!

The $pts[] is merely a string description of your method for calculating team points. If you ranking system does not use points, then leave this as = '{}'.

-------------------
lib/class_stats.php
-------------------

In lib/class_tournament.php look for the function definition of "getMatchStats()" (you can do a search on the string).

Go to the bottom of the function where the following is written:

    // Points definitions depending on ranking system.
    
Here, add your definition of points for your new ranking system in the same style the existing definitions. 
IMPORTANT: If you do not use points in your ranking system, you need not edit in this file at all!

You are now done!
