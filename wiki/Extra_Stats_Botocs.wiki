#summary Extra Stats from Botocs

== Purpose ==

Overview of the extra stats being added for botocs and what is being measured.
Queries and issues can be added to this page and requests for extra stats can be in made in comments.

Some of the stats being collected should be joined together to form more interesting statistics (the rushing_distance_ stats should be summed into a single rushing_distance stat).

All successful stat counts include re-rolls, re-rolls themselves aren't specifically being counted. This would be possible but would require a lot more stats, e.g you would need to know roll fails, re-rolled fails, re-rolled successes, rolled successes. 

I am assuming all player statistics will essentially form the basis for the team statistics so I didn't collect at the team level.

Things that could be added, inducement information

Goblin bombardiers:- I can work out how many bombs were thrown but the effect of the bombs is harder due to OR filtering and the effect of the bombs is a nested effect_roll->next_player->effect_roll thing 

*Special notation:*

The below list is also used by OBBLM to maintain its list of "Extra stats" (ES) fields. Because of this a special notation is applied to the field names, which goes like this:
  * "!" prefix denotes that the field is in a non-working order, and is ignored by OBBLM.
  * "+" prefix denotes that the field is a _common_ (not ES) field used in OBBLM.
  * "%" prefix denotes that the field is *NOT* a _scalar_, which is used by the module linking OBBLM with BOTOCS.
