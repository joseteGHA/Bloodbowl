#summary Extra Stats from Botocs

== Purpose ==

Overview of the extra stats being added for botocs and what is being measured.
Queries and isssues can be added to this page

Some of the stats being collected should be joined together to form more interesting statistics (the rushing_distance_ stats should be summed into a single rushing_distance stat).

All successful stat counts include re-rolls, re-rolls themselves aren't specifically being counted. This would be possible but would require a lot more stats, e.g you would need to know roll fails, re-rolled fails, re-rolled successes, rolled successes. 

I am assuming all player statistics will essentially form the basis for the team statistics so I didn't collect at the team level.

Things that could be added, inducement information
