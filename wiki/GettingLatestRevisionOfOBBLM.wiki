=How to get the latest OBBLM revision=

Here is an easy way I have used in the past to get the latest revision from the repository.  You can of course use any directory and probably best to backup your stuff before hand.
{{{
cd /var/www
wget http://obblm.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ -r -np
find . -name index.html -print | xargs rm -f
}}}
You change directory to your OBBLM directory

Use wget to recursively get the entire OBBLM repository

You then delete all of the index.html files that google code adds to each directory.

It has been a while since I used it this way, let me know if it works for you.

You may also use *TortoiseSVN* - which is very good for windows PCs. Many IDEs (e.g. Eclipse) have SVN support too.
