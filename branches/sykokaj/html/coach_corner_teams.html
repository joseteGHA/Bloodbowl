            <b>Your teams</b>
            <p>
                This is a list of the teams you coach. Only the teams selected by the league commissioner play in the created leagues. This means you are free to make a testing team for yourself. Teams are deletable by the league commissioner as long as they are not scheduled to play any matches.
